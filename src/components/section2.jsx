            I'm a designer turned full stack developer, passionate about
            React.js and <br /> Node.js. I excel in blending technical and
            visual aspects to craft exceptional <br />
            digital products, prioritizing user experience, precise design, and
            optimized <br />
            code.

            Since starting my web development journey in 2015, I've embraced
            <br />
            challenges and kept up with the latest tech trends. Now in my early
            thirties, <br /> seven years in, I'm building cutting-edge web apps
            using Next.js, TypeScript,
            <br /> Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase, and more.

            With a progressive mindset, I enjoy the entire product development
            process,
            <br /> from ideation to execution. Off duty, you'll find me on
            Twitter, tracking <br /> startup journeys, or unwinding. Follow me
            for tech insights and public project <br /> updates on Twitter or
